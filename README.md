# Deep-Learning-Dynamic-MRI-Reconstruction

This is a repository for the project "Deep Learning for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction" as part of the course BME1312 Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Imaging at ShanghaiTech University. The project focuses on using deep learning techniques to reconstruct dynamic MRI images from undersampled data.

TODO: Update the README with a more detailed description of the project, including the specific deep learning models used, the dataset, and any other relevant information.
