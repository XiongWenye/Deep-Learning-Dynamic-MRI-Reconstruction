# Deep-Learning-Dynamic-MRI-Reconstruction

This is a repository for the project "Deep Learning for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction" as part of the course BME1312 Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Imaging at ShanghaiTech University. The project focuses on using deep learning techniques to reconstruct dynamic MRI images from undersampled data.

This project uses deep learning to reconstruct high-quality dynamic MRI images from undersampled data. We propose a deep-learning-based denoising framework combining two independent UNet modules and a 3D ResNet to explore the temporal correlation.
We generate variable density undersampling patterns with acceleration factor 5 and 11 central k-space lines, analyze the resulting aliasing artifacts, and evaluate reconstruction performance with PSNR and SSIM metrics. Additionally, we investigate the effects of dropout, dynamic learning rate schedules and compare L1 versus L2 losses.
